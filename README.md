My Dotfiles

## Dependencies
-> Make sure you have a nerd font installed, preferably (MesloLGS NF)[https://github.com/romkatv/powerlevel10k#meslo-nerd-font-patched-for-powerlevel10k]
-> Install Oh-my-zsh
-> Make sure to install the following plugins - zsh-autosuggestion, zsh-syntax-highlighting, command-not-found. If you are using zsh with my configs.
-> Install lfcd if you want, or just remove that part in the .zshrc, I would recommend going with ranger.
